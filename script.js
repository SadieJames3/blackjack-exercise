The following methods are available to you, defined in htmlFunctions.js:

blackjackHtmlMethods.addCardToCardContainer(card)
Adds whatever text you put in as the "card" parameter to the body
of index.html, contained in the HTML element called "card-container"

blackjackHtmlMethods.addMessageToMessageContainer(message)
Replaces the text of the "message-container" HTML element with
